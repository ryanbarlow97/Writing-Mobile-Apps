# Writing Mobile Apps

In the Robert Recorde Room, CoFo 102, (and Boardroom, CoFo 401) you can find cabinets of historical artefacts taken from the History of Computing Collection. 
The assignments for CSC306 require you to develop a companion app using the Android platform.

This app should provide a login system with three roles: not logged in; standard user; curator. 

When not logged in, a user should be able to find information about each artefact in the cabinets, which might provide details about the development, context, or usage of the artefacts. 

This information must have at least two modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video (others are possible); there must be easy way for a user to get information for the correct artefact.

A user can choose to create an account with the app, which allows them to submit information about an artefact which can be reviewed by a curator. Curators have a privileged user role, and can perform CRUD operations on the artefact information, as well the ability to approve or deny bits of information submitted by regular users. 

You can assume that a curator has the ability to physically open a cabinet.

You should think carefully about the way that information is arranged and displayed to the user, how the user picks which artefact they wish to know about, and how a curator can moderate the user experience.
